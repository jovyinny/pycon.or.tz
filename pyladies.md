**Main Page Content**

PyLadies Tanzania is a mentorship group which focuses on helping more women become active participants in the Python open-source community and we borrow our inspiration from the Python Tanzania Community and the Python Software Foundation. 

Our mission is to really create a diverse Python Language Users community through outreach, education, conferences and social gatherings. PyLadies Tanzania also provides funding for women to attend open source software based conferences. The aim of PyLadies Tanzania is to increase the participation of women in computing and technology.  Plyladies aims to conduct outreach events for both beginners and experienced users which will include hackathons, social nights and workshops for Python enthusiasts.

PyLadies Tanzania goal is to become a multi-chapter organization with the founding of the Dar es Salaam chapter in 2022.  Each chapter will be free to run themselves as they wish as long as they are focused on the goal of empowering women and other marginalized genders in tech. Women make up the majority of the group, but membership is not limited to women and and we also welcome men.

**Code Of Conduct**

Pyladies is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to members to local PyLadies communities, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger PyLadies community of users, developers and integrators through events or interactions.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any PyLadies event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include expulsion from PyLadies Meetup group membership.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of the PyLadies community, IRC chat admins, website admins, or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of PyLadies.
