                    <p>

                        PyCon Tanzania, is seeking for speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to contribute
                        to
                        the Python Conference program! If you use the Python programming language professionally, as a
                        hobbyist or are just excited about Python or programming and open source communities, we'd love
                        to
                        hear from you. We want you and your ideas at the upcoming Python Conference!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Python Tanzania Conference Programme consists of two parts, these being the
                        Talks/Presentations
                        and Tutorials Tracks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Talks: These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference day which. PyCon
                        Tanzania is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive mix of speakers in the lineup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tutorials: As with the talks, we are looking for tutorials that can grow this community at any
                        level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the
                        future
                        of Tanzania through open source software. Each tutorial session runs for 3 full hours plus a
                        break
                        for coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lightning Talks: Lightning Talks are fun, short, five-minute (or less) talks. Ideally each talk
                        should make a single point, often in a fun, quirky or over-the-top way. Slides are optional but
                        often a good image can help get a point across quickly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Best Practices for Speakers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apply: Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We’re available for help with ideas and
                        feedback (contact information is in the section below). Don’t worry about communication skills
                        or
                        English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diversity: We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means
                        we
                        are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve
                        participation
                        from under-represented groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make it detailed: Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if
                        you
                        already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps
                        reviewers make better judgement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Propose early:We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end.
                        Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The code of conduct: All speakers are expected to have read and adhere to the conference Code of
                        Conduct. Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, avoid using
                        sexist
                        language.
                    </p>
